                    <p>We are overjoyed to see our wild neighbors and can feel your delight. Yes, due to our environment of the jungle, we have evolved the sixth sense. We hope to see you soon, but it's possible that some of our wild companions will welcome you first because the road you must travel to get to us is also the trail they go for a nighttime stroll. There are a few crocodiles in a little lake that borders us, but they stay well away from us.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In reality, we arrange for romantic meals to be served on a terrace by the lake under a starry sky, and we promise you that it is lovely. Even as you sip your drink at the bar or relax by the pool, you could see an elephant sipping water from the pool or a group of wild pigs ambling by. Really, we're pals. They come over.

                    <h3>Cinnamon Lodge Habarana</h3>
                    <p>Would you wish to go back in time to a more affluent time when food was 'organic' without calling it that and trees and birds coexisted with people because they trusted them? You're invited to visit Cinnamon Lodge Habarana, which is surrounded by over 2000 trees and is home to a variety of wildlife, including kingfishers, monkeys, and serpent eagles. We like this coexistence, so while we take care of them, we also go above and above and provide everything we do for you at our house a little additional personalization.
